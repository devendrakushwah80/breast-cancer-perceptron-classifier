# 🧠 Breast Cancer Classification using Perceptron

This project demonstrates how to use the Perceptron algorithm for binary classification on the Breast Cancer dataset.

It is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, we:

- Load the Breast Cancer dataset
- Perform data preprocessing
- Apply feature scaling
- Train a Perceptron model
- Evaluate model performance using different metrics
- Visualize results using confusion matrix

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the Breast Cancer dataset available in sklearn.

It contains:
- 30 numerical features
- Binary target:
  - 0 → Malignant
  - 1 → Benign

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🚀 Steps Performed

1. Import required libraries
2. Load dataset
3. Split dataset into training and testing sets
4. Apply StandardScaler for feature scaling
5. Train Perceptron model
6. Make predictions
7. Evaluate model using:
   - Accuracy Score
   - Classification Report
   - Confusion Matrix

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The model performance is evaluated using:

- Accuracy Score
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix (visualized using seaborn heatmap)
